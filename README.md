# Online-mcdonald-Food-Ordering-App

## Problem Statement :-

You have recently taken a McDonaldâ€™s franchise. You, being a software developer, want to design a virtual food ordering system to handle the orders coming in. Users should be able to place orders through it. Whenever one order is complete, it should be visible on the screen with the order number.

## Description :-

1. Create a button called 'Order Food'. Create a checkbox of multiple food items you can choose from.

2. When a user clicks on order food, create a promise that will resolve after random seconds.

3. Once the promise is resolved, show the image of the food in the centre and show the order id on the top right corner.

4. Try to make your virtual restaurant as real as possible.
